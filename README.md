This program is designed for use within the Super Mario Odyssey Speedrunning community and will assist in runs like All Moons & 100%.

If you're towards the end of the run and notice you're missing a moon, quickly look it up within the ingame moon list, run this program, click the kingdom, then the corresponding number and instantly know which moon you need to go back and collect!

Before now, your best (and really *only*) option was to google search the moon and hope IGN's guide popped up, but this can be quite cumbersome in the middle of a run to discern what you're actually after as random videos, maps, pictures and a bunch of other junk all load in as well as the tiny paragraph you're after. With this tool, you no longer need to dig around IGN's website or rely on your twitch chat to do that for you!
